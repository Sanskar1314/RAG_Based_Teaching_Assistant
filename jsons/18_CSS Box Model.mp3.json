    "text": " Guys, in today's video we are going to talk about box model in CSS. In any element, there is content which is itself, then margin, then border and padding. This border, margin and padding are the concept of box model in CSS. In this video, we will understand all these things and see how margin, border, padding are set in CSS. So let's go to the computer screen. I am really very excited. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come inside my computer screen. And the first thing I will do here is show you this playlist. And you guys don't even click on the star here and don't even click here to access. You guys won't do that either. Do it, man. Click on the star here and click here to access. And I have also put the source code for you guys. Access it too. I want you to enjoy it too. Okay, so what do you guys do while enjoying it? The way I made this folder here and what I will do by right-clicking shift, I will open it with code. As you can see, and this VS code will open for me. If your open with code option is not coming, which many people tell me that our open with code option is not coming. So I have a suggestion for you guys. What do you do? Reinstall VS code. Run its setup again. And see what options I have checked. Now I will come in the video and here I will make a file by making a pointer template in the name of index.html. And here I will write CSS box model. After writing the CSS box model, I will make a style tag here. With the help of which I will make you guys. Oops, how did I make a style tag? Is it too fast, guys? No, it's not fast. Okay, it will work. So what will I do while making a style tag here? I will put styles here. And I will tell you how the box model works in CSS. So first of all, let's understand the concept of box model in CSS. What is the concept of box model in CSS? See, everything in CSS is a box. Whatever elements we have made with HTML, they are all a box. Whether we make a container, whether we make a div, whether we make a span. They are all a box in our CSS. And there are some things in that box that I want to show you guys. So if you can see on the computer screen, you will see that here I have explained the concept of CSS box model. CSS box model means that outside your content there is padding. Outside it is border and outside it is margin. So you should know this concept. One more thing I want to tell you guys is that, suppose I made a div.box here. I will write I am a box here. And if I show you the preview of this, then this box has been created by saying I am a box. There is already some margin and padding outside this box. Which you will know when I put a background on it. So what I will do is I will write dot box here. Which means I selected the class selector box. And I will say background color is let us say aqua. So the background color of this box will be aqua. We can do the format document by doing it correctly. So that we will get good formatting. Now you see here there is some margin padding already put in it. What I will do is using a universal selector. It happens that our browser plays a little smart from its side. It says that this developer does not have a brain. So I will put my brain. And it adds margin padding by putting its brain. It adds many more styles. Sometimes you need to reset CSS. So I wrote M-0 here. Sorry, I wrote M-0, so margin became 0. I wrote P-0, so padding became 0. These were Emmet shortcuts. And what will happen by doing this, it will stick to the top. Like the spacing was coming here, it is not coming now. So I wrote I am a box. So let's do one thing, let's write I am a box. And here I wrote div.box. And here I can add multiple classes. By doing box1 and box2. So I made a box and a box1. And I made a box and a box2. So whatever I will select the box and put the properties, it will also apply to this element and this one. Because we can give multiple classes to one element. I told you before. One element can be given multiple classes. And here you can see I have given it a box and box1. I have given it a box and box2. And I will simply write here I am another box. This is our box2. This was box1, this is our box2. Now what will I do inside box2, I will say dot box2 and dot box1. So I will say dot box2 and dot box1. Now you can understand what I have done here. First I will write the property which I want to give to both the boxes. Or suppose I have 10 boxes. So I want to give it in 10th of 10. I will write it as dot box. And some properties will be such that I want to give individually in box1 and box2. So what I will do is I will give box1 class to this and box2 class to this. And if any element has to give more than one class, then we give it by putting space. Can we give more than one ID to any element? Tell me in the comment section below. Let me see. So I have given it a box and box2. So according to me, what will happen if I fill a section like that, will be changed to whatever element is given in the bio-sector. Let me see in the comment section below. Let you understand how much two interaction have happened. Will we be able to erase more than one ID in one element by giving spaces? Let me tell you by confirming this. Should everyone's comment come? I do not know, now you see here I wrote dot box 1. Now I can do what ? I change the blog color to yellow. What will happen by doing this? I will change its color to red. phone color will be red, I will show you, see here the phone color is yellow, here the phone color is red, now what does the box model say, the box model says that the content of your CSS will be here, outside it there will be padding, outside it there will be border and outside it there will be margin, and the total height or width of any element will be added to all this, means the element will cover this much space, total height and width, I did not say height and width, remember, total height means that whatever space it will cover, so this thing you should know, in the CSS box model we have seen only this much, so I have put different classes here, now what I will do, I will say that inside box 1 I will give some padding and I want to give 10 pixel padding, so if I give 10 pixel padding then 10 pixel padding will come from all sides, and to see this you can inspect by right clicking, see this carefully, you see here that I have inspected by right clicking, so you can see here, I have removed my face for a while, I hope you can see here, box and box 1, so here you can see box and box 1, if I hover on box 1 then only this element is selected, see above, see above, see here, see this is selected, and if I hover on this then only box 2 is selected, so by clicking on box 1, this element is selected, I can come here, see I have removed it like this, now I can come here and see everything about it, color yellow, if I want I can change this color temporarily, I will only change temporarily because its source code is written here, so whatever I will change here will be permanent, whatever I will change here will be temporary, so I will not do it now, I will tell you that I can do temporary changes and preview, how it will look if my box color is white, if I reload it then it will be fine, and by selecting this box I will come here again on computed, now as soon as I come on computed, I can see a box, and this box is exactly the same box that I have shown on codebedhari.com, so by this kind of box you will know that the width and height of this particular element, and what is the padding, I have given padding of 10, there is no border, there is no margin, so in this way we have given all these things in this element, let's put a border in it, so till now I have put padding of 10, I am working only in box 1, remember that I am working only in box 1, now what I will do here, I will put margin of 5 pixels, and as soon as I put margin of 5 pixels, what will happen is that it will be outside the element, so the background of the element is not retained, what does it mean, it means that suppose I put pink color on you, suppose I put pink color on you, so you will be pink, but if I throw pink, pink or anything else all around you, then it will not be on you, so this was a very strange example, but I will tell you that padding is outside the content, so if I give padding, then the background color comes in the padding area also, because padding is inside the content, and margin is outside the content, content is inside the element, so the background color will be in the padding area, it will not be in the margin area, so here I have given margin of 5, now I will tell you how to add border, if I write border, and I will tell you about border later, but for now, if I write border 2 pixel solid blue, then the border of 2 pixels is here, and here you see that I have given the border of 2 pixels, you can see that the border is here, so this border is visible to you, and you can see that this is my content and this is border, here what happens is that there is a DPI factor in our display, because of which the actual border will be visible to you, but this is how you can see the margin, border and padding in real time, so I hope you understood this thing, now I will tell you how to calculate the width of the element, now let's say I have given the width or the height of this element 200 pixels, so I have given the height of this element 200 pixels, now I will inspect and show you something, and I will take you to the computed values, so its height is 200 pixels, and you see that I have put an arrow on the content, so it is showing the content, padding is showing padding, border is showing border, margin is showing margin, now you see that the actual height of this element is 200 pixels, then 10 will be added to it, and 10 will be added from below, then the border will be added, then the margin will be added, so as soon as I add all these things, then all this space will come out, but the total width and total height of a particular element is calculated from this formula, that we will add padding to the width, border to the left and right, and margin to the left and right, this is the total width, that is, how much space will be covered by the margin, I hope you understood this thing, and if I talk about the element, that how much space is covering the border, then you will add this whole thing, but now I want to tell you one thing, that if I put a CSS property here, which I can directly put from here, I can add it in styles, I will show you, if I make the background red, then its background will be red temporarily, but I will put it here, I will write box sizing and I will write border box, as soon as I write box sizing, border box, you see that its actual height is 176, 176.8 is because 176.8 plus 20 is 196.8, and after that the border will be added and the total will be 200, we do not include margin here because margin is outside, margin is not included when we set a height and give box sizing property here, try to understand, when I say that its height is 200 or width is 200, so with width 200, if I do not put this, box sizing, border box, listen to this carefully, listen to this very carefully, if I do not put box sizing, border box, then what will happen, then the actual content will be only its height, or if I talk about width, then it will be 200, I will explain you from the example of height, 200 will be the height of its content, then if you talk about the total space that is surrounding it, then padding will be added to it, then the border will be added to it, but if I say box sizing, border box, then I am basically saying that the 200 height that I have told, including the border and padding, it is not included in the margin, but I am telling 200 including the border and padding, where I have done box sizing, border box, it means that the height of my element, the height that I have written here, this height is my border and padding, I have written both together, that is, by combining both, content plus border plus padding should be my 200, when I am saying box sizing, border box, then I am saying this, so everyone tell me in the comment that if we have written box sizing, border box, then what am I saying, I am saying this to CSS that hey CSS God, the height that I am giving you, I am giving this height by combining padding and border, that is, content plus border plus padding, that is 200, this is the meaning of my height, so in a way, box sizing, border box changes the definition of height, what is the definition of the first height, the definition of the first height is that padding will not be included in this, border will not be included in this, it will be the height of this element only, as you can see here, now this is 176, I will remove it from here, by the way, I can also remove it from here temporarily, if I uncheck the box sizing, border box, then see its height is 200, and then I added this to it, then I added this to it, so after combining both, its total height will be 200 plus 20, 220 plus borders, whatever is calculated by it, that will be the sum, but here I want to tell you one thing that if I said box sizing, border box, then what happens is that as soon as the box sizing, border box is written, its height will be reduced from 200 and it will be adjusted in this way that by combining padding and border, it will be 200, I hope that makes a lot of sense, I hope that I have explained to you, so this was a very important concept that I wanted to tell you all, and now the concept that I am going to tell you, you will enjoy it, because in that I will tell you about margin collapse, and this concept you should definitely know, so I will take you again to the computer screen, this was our code, how much margin did I give here, 5 pixels margin, suppose I give exactly the same thing in border 2, and let's increase the margin a little, to make it fun, let's make it 25 pixels margin so that the spacing increases, and suppose I will keep the color red of the other element, same to same thing, and I will also make the border black so that it looks a little different, rest all the values are the same, you can see in this box too, now you tell me honestly that margin 10 10 10 around this box, 10 10 10 10 around this box, so here we should have seen double from this space or not, think again and tell me, that around this, the margin that is around this, if I select this element and show you, then 25 25 25, sorry it is not 10 10, it is 25 25, then this element is also around this, 25 25 25, so this distance should be 50, see 25 is this much, see my arrow above, and this is also 25, so this is also 25, so why is it not 50, the upper element should also be there, and the lower element should also be there, here comes the concept of margin collapse, what is this concept of margin collapse, the concept of margin collapse says that if the margin of two elements is overlapping, then the maximum margin will be applied once, like if I have given a margin of 25 in this, then the maximum margin will be applied once, if I make one of them 35, then the maximum margin will be applied once, so this difference will be 35, so this is called margin collapse, so if I show you a good example of margin collapse in images, I hope I will get a good image, so that I can explain margin collapse, so basically what happens, if I have a box A, I have a box B, this image is looking very good to explain this concept, like I have a box A, I have a box B, I have given a margin of 30 pixels in box A, and 20 pixels in box B, so it will not look like this, but it will look like this, because the maximum margin will be applied once between these two, so this is how the margin will be applied here, so this is called margin collapse, so I hope you understood this concept, what is margin collapse, what is the box model of CSS, how does the box model work, and I tried to explain it to you very well, how is the concept of margin collapse, which annoys a lot of CSS developers, I know people like this, who tell me that is CSS bad, what has happened, why is my margin looking wrong, if you have not accessed this playlist, then do it, and click here to bookmark, and click here to save, I am updating the source code, so
