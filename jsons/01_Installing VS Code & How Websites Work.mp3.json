    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero.

We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And my belief is that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you should learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below. I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that in my Downloads folder. VS Code has come here. And as you can see here. This setup has been downloaded. I will refresh it here. And look here. I can double-click on VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement here quickly. This license applies to. Damages. And after this I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Next we will do. It is important to check both icons here. Checking both icons is very important. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut in the desktop. Create a desktop icon. And after this we will do next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me. Then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow. Then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you. That you subscribe to the channel now. Because these videos. I want exactly you guys. Follow along. As soon as I put the video. You get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally you should subscribe. With that said. Our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Do not be afraid to see this. Beginners do not be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner friendly start. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner? Are you advanced? Or are you an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please. You guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You do not know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you say. Harry, I can also edit code in Notepad. So yes, do it in Notepad. It will also happen in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will also happen in it. Here we set it up. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from Notepad. Look here. We set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I did all this. Next section. After this next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again here are some tips. Telling you. That's it. This is your VS Code here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. Here you can make a new file. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you open this particular folder in VS Code. Now you will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say. Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type. Similarly, you will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want. Save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you. You click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check everything and close it. In settings. Now you don't have to be afraid at all. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this now. Now you press ctrl. Simply like this. If you scroll. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? Very simple. There is such a logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index dot html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this.txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder and this VS code. Both are running in sync. Now if I open this file from here. And I show you. My file will open in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which the notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Suppose html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. Html. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Do not get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use the notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. The developer's feel is coming. The hacker's feel is coming. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come. To do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Things are going to be exactly similar. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. Linux, Mac and Windows. I can't use all three at once. So for you. Things will be exactly the same. In fact I should say. Things will be similar. Not exactly the same. Things will be very similar. Okay. So you can follow along. Very easily. So do not worry at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a while. And you will enjoy. Using those extensions. And you will also say. It is fun. What did you recommend. But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. Before that. I want to tell you. You will click here. You will right click. Click on the command palette. So here. There are a lot of options for VS Code. You do not need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So now see. I will type anything. If I press caps lock. You will know. Which button I pressed. Now this thing is for you. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is screencast mode. What is screencast mode. Its settings. We can change from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode. Vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset 0. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That means. From bottom. How much will it look up. So I made it 0. In fact, I made it 1. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. You will see it at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do. I will close this this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know what it is. What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What exactly is what. Welcome page. You will also see. I will tell you. I will tell you. I will tell you. I will tell you. What is what. What is what. You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in. Because I am recording videos. So ideally. I would like you to see the screen from a distance. But when I am doing my coding. I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work. A website basically. Is a website. It is a website. It is a website. How do websites work. A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client brother. One is server brother. Who is it? One is client brother. Who is the other one? Server brother. Who is the third one? Browser brother. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser brother. Okay. So browser brother. Client brother. Server brother. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. This is the browser. This is the browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am a client. I will tell the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what I basically say. I say to this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. youtube.com. I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. Browser says. Do you want youtube? I say. No. I want to see youtube. I say. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. I say. Give me youtube.com. I say. Do you want youtube? Take this. Okay. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. He brought youtube.com. Do you understand? From the server. He brought youtube.com. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are even faster. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So this fast internet speed. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. So with this fast internet speed. All these things are very fast. Okay. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser of the client. That is, my assistant. Whatever I will say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. Youtube. Youtube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me this kind of code. That is, when I write youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is done by the browser. So I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. This work is done by the browser. That is, how do I show. This work is done by the browser. So the client says something like this. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid. You want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask for youtube.com. Youtube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. That is, a request is made to the server. Says to the server. Give me youtube.com. The server will give it here. Here it will say. Not there. Here it will say. Error. Here it will say. That brother server error. Did not get it. Whatever response will be. Ideally. Which should be 200. A response code. 200. With that response. Which is our browser. It comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. Okay. So the client is with the browser. Browser. To the server. Back to the browser. To the client. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I will tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website. Google.com. So the client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait. I will also bring it from the server. So the server. Goes to the browser. And brings google.com. And gives it to you. You get google.com. Now with google.com. The server. All images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends everything. Like these icons. It sends everything. The URL of these icons. Is also written in this code. And that too. The job of the browser. Is to display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The job of the browser. Now whoever will do further interaction. It will be. It will be. It will be. It will be. It will be. Now whoever will do further interaction. The user. With this page. The browser will make additional requests. If I do right click. And inspect. And after this. I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Assume I wrote. Harry bhai. So see so many requests. It has sent. For images. And many more requests. It has sent. So as you interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it like a restaurant. You gave the order. That is. You sent the request. And the waiter. Then went inside the kitchen. He sent your order to the kitchen. Consider the kitchen as a server. And after this. Finally. When the kitchen gave the order. Back. So what did this waiter do. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. He saw you again. Order. It is possible. That order cannot be made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you guys. Order something. And you did not get it. But it happens. Sometimes. Similarly. Sometimes it happens here too. That error is seen. 404 error. Or 500 error. Server. Is not working. So this kind of error. Whenever you get to see. Then also you are told. But ideally. 200. That is. Ok response. And you get this kind of web page. So you guys. Consider it like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail is available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Code with. A. Dot com. Slash contact. So code with. Dot com. Slash contact. If available. Then it will show you. If not available. Then it will show 404. Or if there is 500 error. Then you guys. Have a blog. Blog has a lot of data. So what will you do? Every web page of the blog. Will store separately. Or you will generate. That content dynamically. You will generate. That content dynamically. I take the example of google. If I search for harry bhai. So you can see here. The header of google. Is. These are links. This format. Does not change at all. If I write here. Assume. Shubham. Assume I wrote Shubham. So as soon as I write Shubham. Now see. When I wrote. Harry bhai. Then it will show. 404. But it is not visible. When I wrote Harry bhai. It's very similar content. Is showing me google. So what does google do? The server of google. Its backend. Backend processes. Data in such a way. That he. Such html. For the corresponding query. Send. Means when I write Shubham. Send this. When I write Harry bhai. Send this. So the process of generating this thing. Is happening through the system. That is the backend. Now this backend. Can be Django. This backend can be flask. This backend can be nodejs. This backend can be ps4. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. This backend can be. Ruby on Rails. And the database inside the backend. Is used. That means the backend code. Is not visible to the client. This is the code of the frontend. Which is sent by the server. And how the server made this code. We do not know. Because this is running on the server. Code. If you are confused. Then don't get confused at all. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend. Now we understand. How does the frontend work? Now the frontend. It is made primarily. By combining three languages. HTML. CSS. PHP. CSS. PHP. PHP. HTML. CSS. And JavaScript. These are the three languages. Which are needed. If you are making a website. Every website needs. HTML. CSS. JavaScript. In most of the cases. If you only use HTML. Then it becomes a very basic. The skeleton of the website. Then when you use CSS. Then you can style it. Like the way this button. Looks like this. It is visible only because of CSS. Along with that. Here this button is visible. Here this button is visible. Or the way this button looks. It is visible. This is all happening. With the help of CSS. This is what is happening. Here. You can see the edges. This is all happening. With the help of CSS. So the work of CSS. Is to style a page. What will be the color of which button. What will happen by hovering. All these things are done. Through CSS. In a way. Beauty of CSS. HTML page. HTML is the existence. Body of any page. Something like this. This is a standard. Which has been agreed. If anyone makes a website. Then it will be made on HTML. So that the browser makers. Can understand. How to parse. The work of the browser. Is to parse. And the browser. Is to understand. How to parse. And the browser. Is to understand. So the work of the browser. Is to parse. HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who will make a website in this world. He will make it in HTML. Skeleton. HTML will use. This is a standard. Such a standard. Has been made. So that. Everyone. Make the same type of pages. And if anyone is making a browser. Then the same language. Has to be parsed. If as a beginner. You have learned 80% HTML. Then you are good to go. For web development. Now. Some things happen directly from HTML. Like. If I show you. A very quick HTML code. Then I will do something like this. I am writing HTML code. By hitting the exclamation mark. I have used. Emmet abbreviation. You guys. Don't worry at all. How I wrote this code. I will write. Hey. This is HTML. And I can open this HTML file. Directly. Something like this. And as soon as I open this HTML file. Directly. Here. You see. It will open here. Something like this. I can open it directly. Actually. By double clicking. Here. Like this. And it opened. Now see. Hey. This is HTML. But it is not styled at all. That is. This HTML file. It is very basic. Now you can run videos directly from HTML. I have an HTML file. Which I show you. With which you can run videos. I do one thing. That I show you. By changing this HTML file. Such that. We can show videos in it. So. There is a video tag in HTML. If you hit the video enter. Then whatever video you put in the SRC. It will play. Like. If I put here. Video 1.mp4. You see. VS code automatically showed me. Video 1.mp4. This is the benefit. To use VS code. So you guys see here. This is the benefit. To use VS code. So you guys see here. I will reload it. So here the video. I can play it. I have to write controls. If I refresh it. So I have the controls to play. I can play. This is a ship. For sale. The man is in dire need. He needs money. 130 crores. Finally. If I put here. Video 2.mp4. I put here video 1. Outside I have 2 more videos. I put here some more videos. That is. This is a ship. To sell. For sale. The man needs money. He needs cash. 130 crores. Final. Now. If I put here video 2.mp4. I have put video 1. I have some other videos here, if I put it here and then I refer them if I put video2.mp4 instead of it then video2 will be seen, I will reload and show you so why did you put the video so put the video of Ben Stokes and show it to people by working hard what have you done these were the lookalikes of Ben Stokes now if I put video 3 here then my third video will be played and you can see I can play it so this is our third video I put video3.mp4 here so I will close it and similarly we can play video4 and video4 is a DJ video in which DJ is played so you can make these things only by using HTML you don't have to do anything else you can play videos and display images all this can be done with HTML now if you want to style it like if I want a border or a red color background then what I have to do for that I have to select a style for that I have to use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website then comes JavaScript which adds interaction to a website for example what will happen when I click on search what will happen when I write code with HRE like code with HRE and autocomplete why did it come, it came because a request went to the server so all these things are done with JavaScript this is called client side scripting if we want to do scripting or coding only on the client side then we can do it with the help of JavaScript this is called brain, so our website is called beauty with brain I am talking about the website beauty with brain CSS adds beauty and brain comes from JavaScript now JavaScript helps you to make the page like if you want to change the content without loading the page then it is done with JavaScript there are a lot of mosquitoes here they are not getting anything my racket is working like the video because I eat the snacks of current when I was in college someone told me that you have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript first learn 100% HTML then 100% CSS but this is wrong because HTML is only 80% CSS is only 40-60% and JavaScript is only 50-70% you can start web development and you can make projects and make them in this course I will tell you about the impact of chat gpt and web development so we will talk about this too, so stay tuned don't run after perfection don't think that I will do HTML for 1 year then CSS for next year, then JavaScript for 3rd year then I will make projects in 4th year do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% and JavaScript 50-70% and you can make a great website and as you make websites your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, JavaScript while you are making money and working as a professional web developer so you are earning along with learning and also improving your skills so don't think that I will make a website only when I learn all HTML tags, CSS properties and JavaScript, I will teach you only that that matters, we are going to learn what matters and I don't want you to learn only for years so I have designed this course so that you can learn only what matters and you can learn other things from practice and I will teach you many things in this course and we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn this course and we will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I will teach you tricks that you have never heard before and I have learned these tricks in my career and I want you to learn these tricks before starting and if you have any doubt in this course you can use this hashtag and ask your doubt I will try to answer all the doubts and I will try to solve your doubts so if you have any question you can ask it in the comment section and you can write it without a doubt so that I can prioritize the reply I will try to answer all the doubts and you will learn everything in this course so like this course that will bring a smile on my face so what is React, Next.js, Angular so all these front end frameworks help you to use JavaScript properly and this process is made by JavaScript and this process is made by JavaScript and we will learn this in this course I told you that I will make this course completely different and I will take you from zero to hero and you have bought the ticket for Sigma web development express and I will give you a good analogy so if you have a car and you have a car with internal engine so that is JavaScript and if you have a skeleton so that is HTML and if you have a skin so that is CSS and if you have a brain so that is JavaScript so that is JavaScript so if I click on inspect so this is the inspect element so here you can see they have used script in head and to add CSS they have used link so I will remove their CSS so to remove CSS I will clear all their style tags so as I remove all their style tags and all their link tags so as I delete all their style sheets so this page looks like this they have only raw HTML and only raw HTML is written here so this is the condition of Forbes without CSS they are showing only raw buttons and raw links and similarly I can remove the script tags and see how it looks without JavaScript and if I delete the HTML tag so I have deleted all the head so this is a blank page so this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for your information this course was made to be paid so I thought to upload this on YouTube so that you all can be serious so many people have reached out to me to launch this course but I wanted to keep this course free because when I was learning web development I could understand and I decided to launch this course this course is free so as you all will earn crores you will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gifts so when you start earning crores then send me a green card but you have to do this only when you start earning good so I will tell you in the next video how you can earn money to complete this course how to get a job how I do freelancing how clients come I will tell you everything I will tell you some action items first is to access the course playlist bookmark the playlist and save some people said that the course is paid thank you so much for all the support and all the love and support but this course is going to be free now there should not be any technical issues I am uploading these videos in 1080p so you all should watch it clearly but many people say that they watch videos in HD and they watch Bali ka Wadhu so I hope you all understood what is request what is response how do these websites work how do client and server interact in the coming videos we will see how the website is made we will make our first website so you should be excited so access the playlist thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time"
