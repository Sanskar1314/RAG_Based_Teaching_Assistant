    "text": " In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form. Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server. These are the forms that you see on contact pages, Google forms or inquiry forms. The date and time to go to the flight or railway ticket, all these details we put, they are also submitted through the HTML forms. In the last video, very few people liked it, I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So let's go to the computer screen, we will see about the forms, we will see about the input tags and we will see some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here which I am going to name video6 because this is the sixth video. I will do shift right click, open with code, I have already told you all this. And here I am going to make index.html and what I will do by putting an exclamation mark in it, I will wrap the view word, I will turn on the screen cast mode and you will see here I will write forms, let's learn it. So I have set the title of this forms page here and what happened by setting the title that the title will be visible on our page. Here I want to tell you a very important setting, show preview, many of you have pointed out to me in the comment that you have to click so many times, can you do something? Yes you can, click on the gear below, click on settings and after clicking on settings, what you do simply, write live preview here, live preview and we can actually set it such that whenever we click, it will open on the external browser. So now I will close everything, as soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser and I come to my browser and the playlist of the Sigma web development course is being accessed by clicking on the star and here on the bookmark. But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, you see it opened, so if you want this, then do this, but sometimes what happens is that you want to prefer side by side view and when you want to do that, when you are actually working on a design using HTML, CSS. Whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see live previews here, which is why this extension was made and it was made different from the live server so that you can see the preview on the side. Now what we will do here, we will know about the form, what is the form, you know the name, the form means that it is a railway form, we fill it and it becomes our reservation, along with that we fill the form of IIT JEE, the form of NEET, the form of any exam, so that our data can reach those who want it, so this is the form, HTML is a form tag, as soon as you write the form, you will enter, in this way the first question will ask you what is the action of your form, get or post, get request and post request, I will tell you a very quick difference in this. I will tell you that we will see this thing when we will read the backend, get request is a very simple request and post request is when we send in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data, like whenever our form will be posted, then in most of the cases we will use post request and get request is a very simple request that we just have to tell the server something and that's it or we have to hit the server with a request, that's it, but if you don't understand this thing now, that should be fine, there is no problem because we are going to do it in detail now. So form action is equal to post, I have written here, now I can show some input tags in it, I will tell you what are input tags, what elements will come in your form, like you can put a date, you can put in the form, you can tell the name, you can tell the phone number, you can say what is your age, it can be just a number, you want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you that the input tag is what you put in the form and there is a label tag which is the one which is used to give that input, so what I will do here, you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text, so I will put the type is equal to text input here and you see here, if I zoom out and show you, so see input type is equal to text, name is equal to username, placeholder is enter your username and it will actually look something like this, that is, you can say here enter your username and the user in front of you will have to enter the username, I write an h1 here and I write here, let's say form to apply for TA for sigma web dev TA, sigma web development course TA, let's say we are hiring teaching assistants for the sigma web development course, so we can write something like this here, by the way I have put subtitles, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it, and along with that I will show you one more thing, so these subtitles are very funny, I will show you, so write sigma batch op and give your village land to me, means if any English speaker is watching this or if any person is watching this who does not know Hindi at all, then he will say that what has happened so far and give your village land to me, it is very easy to see this thing, anyway now you can see here that I have put the h1 here, which is our heading, this is our main heading, enter your username, this is our input tag, along with the input tag, we use the label tag, now whose label is this, so for is equal to I will write its id, I will write its id username and what will I do in for is equal to, I will put its id, now what is this id, I will tell you later, for now you just understand that this is a unique identifier of an element, to identify this element uniquely, like your Aadhar number cannot be of anyone else, in the same way this id username has been given to it, now it cannot be given to anyone else, this is the id, I will tell you more in detail later, but now understand this, so I wrote label for is equal to username, I wrote the input tag and you can see here that the label will come here, so I am seeing here that I have not put anything in the label, so I will put enter your username and you can see that as soon as I put this here, you will get to see enter your username, after this you can enter your username, along with that you can put anything here, like I want to ask what is your gender, so I can do something like this here, and you see enter your gender and as soon as I did this, I can ask you what is male or female, now here what happens is that sometimes we wrap it in div, what is div, div is our block element, and what are inline and block elements, I have not told you in this course yet, but I will tell you in the coming videos, so for now you just understand that I am putting it in div to give a new space, so as soon as I put it in div, it will come in a new space, yes, there is also a br tag, but I don't prefer br tag and you will get to know why, why we don't want to bloat our html with br tag, you will get to know this in the coming videos, now you see here that enter your username, here male or female, now you see here that as soon as I click on female, this radio button is selected, I am clicking on male, this is selected, why is this happening, because the label of this, I have put 4 is equal to female and here I have put id female, you see, and along with that you see I have put the names of both of them, here name is equal to gender, I have put this input tag and name is equal to gender, I have put this input radio tag and as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, it means this is a radio button and if we have made its name same, then only one of these two can be selected at a time, that is, if I select this, then only this will happen, if I select this, then only this will happen, now I show one thing, if I mess up the id in the form of the label, and here also in the form, I don't mess up the first one, I mess up the second one, so when I click on the female of the other one, see it will not be selected, I am clicking, it is not being selected, I am clicking on male, it is being selected, so to select the female, I have to click on it, you see, so what I should do is always put the id of the input tag, so you can see here I have put the label 4 is equal to female, along with that we have an input tag which is type is equal to checkbox, now see here if I put the input of type is equal to checkbox, I will do this work by putting it inside div, I will do this work by putting it inside div, now see here, subscribe to newsletter, here I can check it, and the difference between radio button and checkbox is that you can check the checkbox, if you want male or female, then you can select it like this, after this we have text area and select tag, and I will show you what it is, so text area and select tag works like this, now as you copy the text area, I will show you by putting it, so text area input type is equal to text, but it has rows and column attribute, which helps you to make its size small, now see here the placeholder inside it, I have given enter your comment here, so I have given enter your comment here, ideally we will keep it empty, or we will not give new line, so I will keep it here, enter your comment here, and now it will reach to the left side, so it has reached to the left side, enter your comment here, and any user can put his comment here, now see I have put the content of text area, enter your comment here, so ideally you will not want to do this, you will want to keep the text area empty, and you will want to put a label, and you can say label for is equal to comment, and definitely we will put id here, whenever we put for, then the element for which it is inside the for, its id, now see here, if I write enter your comment here, then what will happen, if I write enter your comment, then it will come here, now you will say that this is not styled properly, so this style is not properly, because we will style it with CSS later, now for this I will put just br tag, but I don't recommend br tag, I am telling you again, I don't recommend br tag, because br tag has problems, by the way you should know br tag, it is a line break tag, it has a line break, now you must be thinking that everything is fine, but I will tell you br tag is something that I don't recommend, it is not like that, you don't have to use it, but I don't recommend using it all the time, means the easiest thing is that people think that you should put br tag and keep adding new spaces, I oppose this a lot, so I will copy this and show select tag to you, and you see here, as soon as I put select tag here, I put it inside div, so in select you get some options, the syntax of select is like this, making apple and you can use any of the three cherries, now you see here, any of the three can be used, and here I have done value is equal to apple, first I made select tag, then name is equal to fruits, then option value is equal to apple, option value is equal to banana, option value is equal to cherry, when we will parse this form data, then I will tell you in javascript part, how to take this data and send it to the server, so there are many things about form that are remaining, I am going to tell you, so stay tuned for that, so this was about forms, I wanted to tell you all the elements of forms in this video, and along with that I have told you about select tag, and about form, the rest of the attributes, like action, I told you, you can submit form on any page from action, and where will it handle, so you can give that data here, then there is a method, get request or post request, I will tell you the difference in these two in the coming videos, but I have told you in a very rough way, that get request is a very simple request, post request is used when you have to send big data to the server, because get request has a limit, in post request you can send a lot of data, in get request we never send passwords, we send with the help of post request, now here I have told you the method, what happens in name, name is equal to username, means we mark it with name, so the server will know which key value is corresponding to this, so the key value that will go to the server will go according to the name, its name and value will go, so we will see this also when we will do server side processing, placeholder means what will be written inside it, like here enter your username, placeholder, if I click on this, then enter your username is not written inside it, I will write anything, see it came, but enter your username is telling me that I have to put username in it, then required means you have to require it, you have to put its value, otherwise your form will not be submitted, so we will use this a lot, then after this we get autofocus, what does autofocus do, autofocus automatically focuses the cursor, so I will show you the magic of autofocus, so you have written autofocus in the input tag, so I have written autofocus in enter your username, now I will reload it, so if I type on it, then automatically focus will be on it, so autofocus means that whenever you type, it will be typed here, I hope you are understanding things, now I have told you the validation attribute required, you can give pattern, in which you can give regular expression pattern, now don't get confused, don't say what are you talking about, we don't know regular expression, so I am sitting here to teach you all things, just understand that we will accept only one particular pattern, if we have put pattern is equal to this, then you can't put anything other than this pattern, so you should know this thing here, so I hope you are enjoying this video, and with that, do write sigma batch op in the comment section, and please review this course in the first video, because still many people ask me that should I do this course or not, free course is not valued by people, they say that this course is free, so we should watch it or take a paid course, and I would like to give a note for those people who said that we took a paid course, now what should we do, they should collect money or we should join sigma batch, you should join sigma batch, cut your losses and join sigma batch, because I don't think you need to tell me what is the quality of this course, so you should come and do this, you will get everything here, I am telling you, I was going to sell you for 10,000 rupees in this course, and I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course, but the thing is if you have bought any other course and you still feel that sigma is a very good course, then you should join, cut your losses and join, because once you make your career, then you will not need any of these things in the future, so you will also say that we took a paid course and then we took a free course, and if you become a career, then all these things will not matter in the future, so do what is right for you and do your work while understanding your rights and wrongs, I hope you are understanding things, so like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel, and write sigma batch op in the comment section below, and name your village and town in my name, that's all for now, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time."
