    "text": " Guys, in video number 12, I gave you an exercise and I told you all to post your solution. In today's video, I will solve that exercise and tell you. And I am going to give a shoutout to all those people who have solved that exercise. Let's go to the computer screen. I am really very excited to see your solutions. Let's roll the intro. \ud83c\udfb6 Music \ud83c\udfb6 So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And the first thing I will do is make a folder named video 16. So I will write here video 16. And after opening it, right click on it and open with code. And after doing this, I will make a boilerplate template here. Today we are going to do a little special work because today we will get a shoutout to everyone. So first of all, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it. Now I am going to open this video here. So I opened this video in which I had given you exercise. And this exercise was about a pure HTML media player. Okay, so I told you to make a media player in this. And here I am doing sort by new as first. And I will come down completely. And after coming down completely, what I will do here is that I will give a shoutout to all the people who have solved it. So guys, I have scrolled all the way down. It took me a long time to scroll, to be honest. I will give a shoutout to everyone. But before that, I want to solve this question for you. So here you can see 1.mp3, 1.mp4, 2.mp3, all the way till 5.mp3. So what I will do first is I will put an h1. My videos for the day. Okay, I will write h1 here. And here I will write some audios for the day. Okay, I do my videos and audios for the day. What I will do here is that I will toggle the screencast mode. Because it looks a little easy to you. And here some videos. So I wrote an h1 and here I put an h2. And here I will simply put videos in a div. So as soon as I write the video tag here, and after that I will write the controls here. So I will actually be able to watch this 1.mp4. What I will do simply is that I will press the shift, alt and down arrow. And here I will write 2, then I will write 3, then I will write 4. And then I will write 5 here. And I will do the same thing for audio as well. And here I will write audio and here I will write 1.mp3. And after that I will write controls. Okay, and after that I will do the same thing. And I will replicate it 5 times. I did 2, I did 3, I did 4. And here I will do 5. And obviously I will try to show you by previewing it here. Now there is a problem here. And the problem is that it is taking the full width. And it is becoming very problematic for me. I guess maybe because I am zoomed in. Okay, so it is not becoming problematic actually. Otherwise we would have reset it with CSS, whatever we do. But for now, I think we are good. We will see how to resize it in CSS. How things can be improved. But I think our videos have come here. And some audios for the day have also come. So you can see the audios. And if you will put songs, then songs will come. I have not put songs. Here you can see that my videos are playing. And these are the videos. And this is my personal favorite. So you must have put your favorite videos. But that was pretty much about it. Many people are saying that it is very easy. This exercise was so simple. We will raise the bar like anything. Remember, just remember what I said. What is left? Now we will give shoutout here. So Soumya172 shoutout. Shoutout to Code with Rohit who accepted the challenge. Here multiatmos, desiready, shantop, Harsh Gularia. Then Hellstar Kun, Team Rewa, Kulsoom Saqibwar. Then shoutout to Bobby01th. Shoutout to Mohan, 2492, Prakash, Arnab. Then shoutout to Jilan, HR, Nikhil, Ashutosh. And now I will give shoutout to those who have solved. I will give shoutout to those who have solved. Has anyone solved? I will even see the replies. Has anyone solved? I will see the replies. Has anyone solved? No one has solved yet. Has anyone solved? No one has solved. No one has solved yet. No one has solved yet. Okay, so Coder Anderson. Congratulations to you all. You have won 7 crore rupees. For the first time you have used the table which is fine. And the thing is that ideally tables are not used. To be honest, so this kind of work is done especially. But I think we are good. From 1 to 6, they have shown the videos. They have also given width and height in the video. Which is a great thing. Actually, I will also do it in my video. In fact, what I will do is that I will write width is equal to 239. Let's see how it changes. Oh wow, it is looking actually better. So why didn't this idea come to my mind when I was solving? Cody Anderson, shoutout to you all. Sorry, shoutout to you, Cody Anderson. Now after this, who has solved the next one? Saif0981. Shoutout to him also. You have solved it beautifully. Very good. Very amazing. Then shoutout to Czar Morty. I have given a big shoutout. And shoutout to Jheel Maheshwari. Now I want to say that many of you have not solved it. And this was not the participation I was looking for. I wanted more of your participation. I wanted everyone to solve it. Very few people have solved it. And I want more people to solve it. So I want to say that I have solved it. And I have seen that very few people have solved it. And here I don't see any other code. So in the coming videos, I want everyone to solve the challenges. And whoever solves it first, I will give him a shoutout in the comments. So you will have to respond a little fast. And shoutout to all those who are writing challenge accepted. I hope you are enjoying watching this course. All the source code and the playlist, you must access it. The playlist looks very popular. It was a few days ago, there were two videos. One video was written by Jeebs. But now the videos have been filled. And your enthusiasm should also be constant like this. If you have not accessed the source code, then you must access it. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Outro Music."
