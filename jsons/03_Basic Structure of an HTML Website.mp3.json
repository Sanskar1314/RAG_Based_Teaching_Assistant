    "text": " What's up guys, you are back to the Sigma web development course. I am really very happy that you all have given so much love to this course. Like this course with high energy. Because for a Sigma free course, you need to like the Sigma chats. In today's video, I will explain you the basic structure of a website. Along with that, I will tell you a mobile trick which will help you to know how to preview your website on your phone. I have a request from you all that you all write in the comment section whether you know HTML or not. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I will tell you the impact of chat GPT. Because there are a lot of talks going on about chat GPT these days. In the coming videos, I am going to give you a quiz. So understand this video very carefully and learn all the concepts. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come inside my computer screen. And now we will talk about how to create a layout of a website based on opening text, closing text, and structure. So here I will create a folder named video3. New folder, video3. And in video3, I will open it by right-clicking and selecting open with code. And here you can see that my theme is blue. And many people said that blue theme is not good. Now see, the theme is your own choice. If you want to change the color theme, then you can change your color theme. If you want to use GitHub dark, then you can use GitHub dark. It's your choice. To create a new file, I will put index.html here. We had already talked about it that if I write the title of the page here, and write content here, and then using the link tag here, I can use Emmet here and link style.css. I am doing it so fast because we have already talked about it in the last video. And if I write script.js here, and if I write let us say alert hello here, then I will not tell you again and again that if I put a script tag here, just before the body, and then I put script.js here, and then I click here and open with browser, then this hello will come, and if I make the background of the body red here, then it will become red. I will not tell you all this, because I have already told you this. Now I will tell you that what does this structure mean? Why did I write it so big? This is a doubt for a beginner that we can't write this title and content directly, what is the need to write so much? So I will tell you what is the need to write so much? I will reload it, see the content that was here has come and it has become red here. Now here you saw that I needed to reload the page. Many of you will ask why did I need to reload when it already reloads live? So I changed the CSS file. When I change the CSS file, at times we need to reload. If you are making changes in the HTML file, then you don't need to reload the changes in the HTML file. Now here what I will do is I will come back and explain to you. This is a basic structure of any HTML website. First of all, we write doc type HTML, then we write HTML tag. Now see this is the opening tag of HTML tag, this is the closing tag. This is the opening tag of body, this is the closing tag. This is the opening tag of head, this is the closing tag. That means whatever is inside it is the content of head. Whatever is inside the HTML is the content of HTML. Accordingly, whatever is inside the title is the content of the title. Now you will say what is the content of meta? So meta is a self-closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML, one is self-closing tag and one is pair tag. What happens in pair tag is that your opening tag is the closing tag. So this is the basic structure of HTML website. Now here you saw that the background has become red. Who is this background red? This is happening because of CSS. If I remove CSS from here and tell CSS to move away from here quickly. What will I say to CSS? Move away quickly. And as soon as I tell CSS to move away quickly, it will have to move away from here. I will reload the page. So you can see that it has moved here. Similarly, I can also say to JavaScript that move away quickly. Now see, if I say from here, then the alert will also stop. So you see, if I reload now, then the alert will also stop. So the CSS and JavaScript I added in the HTML content, we used it additionally to link CSS and JavaScript functionalities with this HTML page. Now I have already told you about the title tag. This is used to set the title of the page. Now the only purpose of this is that you see the title above. The search engines that are there, they also use it. That is, the search engines like Google, if you write here, code with Harry HTML, then the HTML introduction of code with Harry, HTML working, I have put all these titles on the page. You see here above, HTML introduction is the title of the page. So these titles of the page are used by the search engines and are parsed. Now see, if I change the page here, then the HTML title is working here. Now I will change the page again, you see here the HTML installation has been done. So the titles keep changing. Along with that, as I keep changing it, it will keep changing, as you can see. So the title of HTML pages does not only mean that you can see this above. These are also very useful in SEO. And they tell what is the content inside the page. So they describe the page content. Like I am getting to know what is HTML execution here. HTML execution means how HTML is being executed. I am being told about this page. So changing the title of the page is a very good SEO practice. So we will make a website from any framework, we will keep changing the title of the page. Now here is the head section, the metadata of the page is inside the head section. Like the title is done, and which script do you want to link with, that is done. Along with that, there are other metatags, about which I will tell you later. Metatags basically means that how is the HTML document, it is told about it, keywords are added, descriptions are added. Meta description is a very important keyword for SEO. That is, you can write about what this page is about. If you go to my website, then you will get to see here in view page source, that the meta description tag is attached. This is compressed HTML, so don't be confused by this. But here you can see that the meta description tag is attached, which describes this page. If we talk about Google, then the meta description tag is shown here. Now I want to show you people that what happens inside the doc type, HTML, and head, that the meta tags, title tags, script tags, and link tags of the page are also there. So now you can put the script tag just before the body, and you can put it above too. And what is the difference in this, we will talk about it in the next course. But here you can see that I used the link and added CSS again. Then after this, the body is the main content of the website, which you can see on this page. So what you will see on this page will be the body. Whatever you put inside the body, you will see here. And whatever script you put will be executed. Now by putting a script here and by putting a script in the head, what will happen, I will tell you in the course. But this is a basic structure of the HTML website. Lang is equal to en is an attribute. If you put lang is equal to en inside any tag, then lang is an attribute whose value is en. So these key value pairs are used, which tell about this tag. Like in meta tag, name is equal to description is used. So name is equal to description is an attribute. And if you hover in VS code, then it will tell you a lot about it. See I hovered on the name, so it is telling about this whole attribute, that why this attribute is used, how it is used. Now most of the content inside the body, mostly the HTML raw, you will copy it. Mostly from websites like codewithari.com, you will come here and copy the source code. Like if I talk about forms, then you will come to this page of HTML forms, and you will start making your form and modify it. So copying and pasting is very important according to me. As a senior developer, you should know where to copy and paste and when to do it. And I am not saying this sarcastically. Okay, I am not saying sarcastically. This thing will always be the same. Now you type it or copy and paste it. Obviously, you will prefer to copy and paste it. Because this change is not going to happen. The form will remain the same. And if you copy and paste, then your time will be saved. Then you have to put your mind in innovation, which cannot be copied and pasted. So you can consider this as a sigma rule that you will copy and paste what has to be copied and pasted. And where you have to put your mind, that cannot be copied and pasted. So you will save time and put your mind there. The most important part of being a senior software developer is to where to copy and paste from, which stack overflow question to copy and paste from, and how to paste it from where. Copyright Code Withari 2024-25-26 whatever you understand. I have said this is my copyright statement. But this statement is very strong. Now I will tell you about a technique with which you can see this website, whatever we will develop here, you will be able to see it in this mobile. Now listen to the steps carefully. Right click, open terminal. And write ipconfig. If you are in the old version, then you can open command prompt or powershell. As soon as you enter by writing ipconfig, you will see here that you will get to see ipv4 address. 192.168.1.199 Now the IP address we got here, I will copy it. So I will copy this ipv4 address. And I will write live preview in my settings. This local IP host address to host your files on, this is written, I will write my IP address instead of it. And after doing this, I will restart my VS code. You have to ensure one more thing that you go to your Wi-Fi settings, and make your network a private network. It should not be a public network, it should be a private network. Network and Internet, Wi-Fi, whichever Wi-Fi you are connected to, make it a private network. And now you will right click and preview the show. So you will see here, you will get to see your IP address, slash index.html. I can use this on my phone too. So I will quickly put this IP address here. So I put 192.168.1.199 colon 5000 Your 3000 can also be, whatever your port is, you put it. And look here, my website has been previewed on mobile. This trick comes in handy when we want to preview on our mobile. Because these days, most of the websites are seen on the phone. So we want our phone users to be able to enjoy our website well. And we are developing in the computer, so that testing will be done. Now if you have not put your review in the first video, then I will request you to come to the first video and review your course. I told you in the last video, please review it. Put an initial review, how did you feel after seeing so much course? You write initial review there. As soon as you write initial review, people will know what is the initial review of this course. You give me 5 stars. Along with that, do access this from the playlist description. Click here and bookmark it. Or if you click on the star, it will be bookmarked. And it will start showing in your bookmarks. I have bookmarked it here in the Sigma Web Development Course. Click here and save it too. Very few people have accessed the playlist. So I want everyone to access this playlist. Bookmark and save this playlist too. So access the playlist, like the video, name both your village and uncle's land. Thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time."
